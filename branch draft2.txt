Anchipolevsky, This is a temporary fix for the issue with cassandra restarts.
The '7386db34' commit introduced a creation of RevisionInfoBean without setting anything to parentRevisions (RevisionInfoTable).
For some reason it stops cassandra from successful restart.
Could you please test how it works now?

I will investigate a root reason but it looks like it's a one more bug in Cassandra.
